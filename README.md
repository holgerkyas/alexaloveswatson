Welcome to the Lab exploring the digital romance of Alexa & Watson!

The purpose of this lab is to show how you can integrate the personal assistant “Alexa” (Amazon Echo) with cognitive capabilities from IBM Watson.
The basic lab is about integrating Alexa with Watson Tone Analyzer. The goal is to capture whatever you say by Alexa and then analyzed by Watson. It will take a beginner approx.. 2h to get a running prototype. The lab can be extended flexibly to 3-4h since there are additional scenarios in the appendix.
